Comfortable and safe five seater family Sedan with reasonable luggage space," Safety: Advanced safety features including airbags, ABS, traction control, and stability control",Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD): Optimize braking force distribution between the front and rear wheels for maximum effectiveness,"The architecture of the Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) system consists of several components and subsystems that work together to optimize braking force distribution between the front and rear wheels. Here's a detailed layout of the architecture.

1. Brake Pedal: The driver applies force to the brake pedal to initiate braking. The force applied is converted into a hydraulic pressure signal.

2. Brake Master Cylinder: The hydraulic pressure signal from the brake pedal is received by the brake master cylinder. It amplifies the hydraulic pressure and sends it to the brake system.

3. Brake Fluid: This hydraulic fluid is responsible for transmitting the hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder to the brake calipers or wheel cylinders.

4. Brake Calipers and Wheel Cylinders: These components convert the hydraulic pressure into mechanical force. In a disc brake system, the brake calipers squeeze the brake pads against the brake discs, creating friction to slow down or stop the vehicle. In a drum brake system, the wheel cylinders push the brake shoes against the brake drums to achieve the same effect.

5. Wheel Speed Sensors: These sensors are installed at each wheel and measure the rotational speed of the wheels. They provide real-time feedback to the EBD system about the speed of each wheel.

6. EBD Control Unit: This control unit is responsible for analyzing the wheel speed sensor data and determining the optimal braking force distribution between the front and rear wheels. It utilizes algorithms and logic to calculate the appropriate brake pressure for each wheel.

7. Actuators: The EBD control unit sends signals to the actuators, which can be solenoid valves or electric motors, to adjust the brake pressure applied to each wheel. The actuators modulate the hydraulic pressure to increase or decrease the braking force on individual wheels as necessary.

8. Anti-lock Braking System (ABS): In many vehicles, the EBD system is integrated with the ABS. The ABS prevents the wheels from locking up during braking by rapidly modulating the brake pressure. The EBD control unit communicates with the ABS control unit to coordinate the braking force distribution and the ABS modulation.

9. EBD Indicator: This indicator is typically located on the instrument cluster or dashboard. It provides feedback to the driver about the status of the EBD system. It may illuminate or flash to indicate a fault or if the EBD system is actively adjusting the brake force distribution.
