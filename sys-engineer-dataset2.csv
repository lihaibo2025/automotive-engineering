The electric motor(s) can be paired with a traditional transmission or a single-speed reduction gearbox.

2. Battery Pack: This is the energy source that powers the electric motor(s). The battery pack can be made up of multiple individual battery cells that are connected together to provide the necessary voltage and capacity for the vehicle. The battery pack is usually located in the floor of the vehicle to maximize interior space.

3. Power Electronics: This component manages the flow of electrical energy between the battery pack and the electric motor(s). It includes a DC-DC converter that steps down the high voltage of the battery pack to a lower voltage to power the vehicle's auxiliary systems, as well as an inverter that converts DC power from the battery pack into AC power for the electric motor(s).

4. Onboard Charger: This component allows the battery pack to be charged from an external power source, such as a wall outlet or charging station. The onboard charger converts AC power from the external source to DC power for the battery pack.

5. Regenerative Braking System: This system captures energy that would otherwise be lost during braking and converts it into electrical energy to recharge the battery pack. When the driver applies the brakes, the electric motor(s) act as generators and convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle into electrical energy that is sent back to the battery pack.

6. Control System: This is the ""brain"" of the powertrain and manages the operation of all the components. The control system monitors inputs from various sensors, such as the accelerator pedal position and the battery pack's state of charge, and adjusts the power output of the electric motor(s) and the regenerative braking system accordingly.
